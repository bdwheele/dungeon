# The number of exits the start room has

# The odds of having a local connection vs creating a new node
# this controls how bushy vs viny the map is.  The more local
# connections, the bushier.
node_connect_local:
  true: 6
  false: 9

# if it is a local connection, how many levels away do we allow the 
# destination to be in terms of distance from start?

# Node Classification
#

# This determines the ratio of rooms vs corridors
node_type:
  room: 70
  corridor: 30


#
# Edge Classfication
#
# The following tables are the weights of connecting
# two nodes together, based on the node types
room_to_room:
  door: 60
  passage: 40

room_to_corridor:
  door: 70
  passage: 30

corridor_to_corridor:
  passage: 90
